This is a Python-based Discord chat bot that uses the discord.py library. It can respond to messages using GPT3 and GPT4, It also utilizes the [Imaginepy](https://github.com/ItsCEED/Imaginepy) for generating midjourney like images.

Now, let's talk about the bot's features. It has **OCR** for images, so it can read text from images. It can also do web searches using **DuckDuckGo** and even summarize **YouTube** videos for you. Pretty handy, right?
